  Welcome to my mind and my life. This is a platform for me to put down thoughts
  and track progress. This is also a way for me to publicize what I am working
  on. 

  This is also one way for me to figure out what I like doing, versus
  keeping it all in my head. The problem is that the mind is limited
  in terms of processing capabilities. However if I can store it
  somewhere and keep tabs on it, I will retain more.

** The will to change 
   You want to change you life, in ways for the better. How do you do
   it? You have to focus on your habits, will-power and faith. Maybe
   not in that order, but in some way there is a fundamental chnage
   needed. Goals are devices that indicate success. your health and
   exercise heavily affect your drive and focus. 

   Self-Discipline, time management, mind management and space
   management all affect the final goal. There is a struggle, the
   fight is real, you'll need tools and divine light on your side.

   Start with your morning routines and other aspects will closely
   follow. Disciple in spirituality will radiate into exercise,
   knowledge, work, and family. Faith is God is the foundation. 

   Focus is essential, you notice your mind wandering quite often, and
   you think why can't I just do it. You lack focus. Kung Fu thought
   you focus, you realized it with the various movements and the
   points you had to hit consistently. You somewhat had focus before,
   but now it's lost, find it.

   Be purpose driven not passion driven. Purpose is having your end
   goal in mind, your ego is big enough to tell you that you can do
   everything. But you can't, you need to look at your end goal and
   priotize the time. Remember the 80/20 rule, spend 20% of you time
   on stuff that will give you 80% of the impact.

** Life consists of
   My theory is that life can be broken down into these factors:
   1. Spirituality
   2. Experiences
   3. Emotions
   4. Knowledge
   5. Physical Capabilities
   6. Relations
   7. Habits

   purpose. Purpose is driven by what is meaningful to you. Choices
   drive your goals.
