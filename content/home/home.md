Welcome to my mind and my life. This is a platform for me to put down thoughts
and track progress. This is also a way for me to publicize what I am working
on.

This is also one way for me to figure out what I like doing, versus
keeping it all in my head. The problem is that the mind is limited
in terms of processing capabilities. However if I can store it
somewhere and keep tabs on it, I will retain more.
