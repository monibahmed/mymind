Welcome to my mind and my life. This is a platform for me to put down thoughts
and track progress. This is also a way for me to publicize what I am working
on.

This is also one way for me to figure out what I like doing, versus
keeping it all in my head. The problem is that the mind is limited
in terms of processing capabilities. However if I can store it
somewhere and keep tabs on it, I will retain more.


## The will to change {#the-will-to-change}

You want to change you life, in ways for the better. How do you do
it? You have to focus on your habits, will-power and faith. Maybe
not in that order, but in some way there is a fundamental chnage
needed. Goals are devices that indicate success. your health and
exercise heavily affect your drive and focus.

Self-Discipline, time management, mind management and space
management all affect the final goal. There is a struggle, the
fight is real, you'll need tools and divine light on your side.

Start with your morning routines and other aspects will closely
follow. Disciple in spirituality will radiate into exercise,
knowledge, work, and family. Faith is God is the foundation.

Focus is essential, you notice your mind wandering quite often, and
you think why can't I just do it. You lack focus. Kung Fu thought
you focus, you realized it with the various movements and the
points you had to hit consistently. You somewhat had focus before,
but now it's lost, find it.

Be purpose driven not passion driven. Purpose is having your end
goal in mind, your ego is big enough to tell you that you can do
everything. But you can't, you need to look at your end goal and
priotize the time. Remember the 80/20 rule, spend 20% of you time
on stuff that will give you 80% of the impact.

## Life consists of {#life-consists-of}

My theory is that life can be broken down into these factors:

1.  Spirituality
2.  Experiences
3.  Emotions
4.  Knowledge
5.  Physical Capabilities
6.  Relations
7.  Habits

Life should be driven by your values trying to achieve a
purpose. Purpose is driven by what is meaningful to you. Choices
drive your goals.
