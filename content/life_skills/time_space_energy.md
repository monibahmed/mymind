In life, we are essentially provided with three fundamental
resources. Time, space and energy. Time is the physical
actualization of the fact that everything is moving forward. Time
keeps going. Space is the actualization, that objects relating to
time, also occupy a phyiscal space in our 3-dimension world. Energy
is the resources used to carry out certain tasks. Energy exists in
potential form, and can be used to do work.

God has provided with all three resources naturally, and has put us
into a situation where we must make our own choices. The choices we
make physically are related to our values and purpose in life. As we
travel through life, the choices we make are dependent on now these
five aspects. Time, space, energy, purpose and values. These are
somewhat constant, unless a considerable amount of force is given to
change one of these. Let take for example, space. We typically carve
out our space as soon as we enter this world, and then keep carving
it to our **personality**. It takes a considerable amount of physical
and emotion effort (force), to move this space to another
location. For example when you buy a house or move into an
appartment. There is a considerable amound of force needed in time,
space and energy.

Time, space and energy can be also thought of as a currency that is
spent during life. Life is a very complex and different all living
creatures. But it can be catogerized as well. Life consists of a
unique combination of experiences, physical attributes, emotions,
habits, spiritual influences, knowledge, and relationships. Our goal
is to spend Time, Space and Energy on these categories to get the
most out of life. In otherwords, we should shoot and optimize for
efficiency. If machines can do it, why not us?

We are just more complex machines, how do we understand
machines. Ultimately how do we understand ourselves? Machines are
programmed to do predefined tasks. What were the predefined tasks
that we are programmed with? The first and obvious is the ability to
seek out nourishment. This would fall into the physical attributes
of life.
